### [Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/dspnavyasri/Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)

- Brief overview:  This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using various machine learning classifiers. The sentiment analysis involves predicting whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment based on its text.

- Data: The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. The data has been preprocessed to remove non-alphabetic characters, convert text to lowercase, tokenize words, remove stopwords, and lemmatize tokens. The final dataset has been balanced using oversampling techniques.

- Technologies Used : Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), scikit-learn, NLTK

- Results : Achieved an accuracy of 85% in sentiment classification using a Random Forest classifier.
