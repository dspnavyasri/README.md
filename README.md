# Data Engineer Portfolio
Hey there,


Greetings! My name is Shankara Parameshwari Navya Sri, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering courses or self development exercises, each of which covers essential skills and techniques.

I'm deeply enthusiastic about data science, cloud computing, and virtualization. With a solid foundation in languages like Python, R, and JavaScript, along with expertise in various libraries, frameworks, and developer tools, I'm continually expanding my technical repertoire.

You can read a more detailed description of my background and skillset on my resume here.

### Project 1: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

- **Overview**: This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using various machine learning classifiers. The sentiment analysis involves predicting whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment based on its text.

- **Data**: The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. The data has been preprocessed to remove non-alphabetic characters, convert text to lowercase, tokenize words, remove stopwords, and lemmatize tokens. The final dataset has been balanced using oversampling techniques.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), scikit-learn, NLTK

- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 85% in sentiment classification using a Random Forest classifier.


### 2. High-School-Announcements-Analysisand-Text-Classification

**Overview:** Project involves the analysis of announcements made by teachers at a high school. The dataset contains information about the announcements, including the title, content, teacher's name, submission time, and category.

### 3. Demographic Analysis

**Overview:** This project conducts a demographic analysis focusing on various aspects such as birth rates, death rates, suicide rates, fertility rates, life expectancy, population, area, and population density across different countries.
